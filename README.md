# Apollo-Miner-Docker

Dockerization of the FutureBit Apollo BTC miner binaries.\
Please refer to [the original repository](https://github.com/jstefanop/Apollo-Miner-Binaries) for detailed instructions on how to configure the start script.\
This repository focuses on running the docker images on [Umbrel](https://umbrel.com/), hence only Linux binaries were kept in the repository.
